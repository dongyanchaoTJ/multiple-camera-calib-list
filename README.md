# A list of tools for multi-camera calibration

## CamOdoCal
<br>
The package comes with both intrinsic and extrinsic calibration for multi-camera system. The advantage of this technique is that it does not require overlapping fields of view between cameras and thus this is applicable for the rear camera. A plus advantage is that this work has also been tested on a van mounted with a four-camera rigs on the roof, which is similar to our system. In order to determine the scale metric between cameras, it requires odometry data which can be from the wheel or GPS/IMU system. The package is developed in C++ on Ubuntu platform.<br>
